# Segmentation-Toolbox-for-Medical-Imaging
A PyTorch codebase template for medical imaging segmentation developed by Jesse Sun from Dr. Bo Wang's lab at UHN. 

We made this codebase public to speed up the development of machine learning research in healthcare.

Currently, the codebase is linked to the database AC17. You may override the `data/ac17_dataloader.py` file by writing your own custom dataloader class for your dataset of choice. 

Only supports 1 GPU currently. Cannot run without a GPU.

TODO:
1. Comment all the code.
2. Add a file on how to navigate the codebase.

There may be some instabilities currently. Notably, directory locations are left blank or have `'./'` prefixing it, please
fill in the locations depending on where you are storing the files on your environment.
